# DarkModeEverywhere-Fabric

Unofficial Fabric port of DarkModeEverywhere[^1]. It will be as maintained as I have time (and willpower) for.

I've kept the upstream branches as `ver-forge` instead of `ver`, which will now be fabric release for ease of development.
I'll try to keep the `main` branch just a clone of the most recent version.


[^1]: Techincally actually a fork of [TeamAOF/DarkModeEverywhere](https://github.com/TeamAOF/DarkModeEverywhere), but that fork (and its upstream) doesn't seem to be maintained. The only commit taken from that fork is 4cdf797d7eef8de0820cc48ab369a39388e74a99.
